# GPU Hardware Acceleration - Driver Compatibility Guide

## Summary

This application uses NVIDIA GPU acceleration for both:
1. **Video decoding** (FFmpeg with CUDA) - for extracting frames from videos
2. **Image matching** (PyTorch with CUDA) - for comparing frames to reference images

## Current Implementation

The application now uses **adaptive hardware acceleration** that automatically detects the best available method and gracefully falls back if issues are encountered.

### Detection Priority Order
1. **CUDA** (NVIDIA GPU) - Preferred for maximum performance
   - Tested with real H.264 video (23KB test file)
   - If CUDA works, also tests **GPU scaling** (scale_cuda filter)
   - Enables full GPU pipeline when available: decode → scale → download
2. **QSV** (Intel Quick Sync) - Fallback for video decoding
3. **VAAPI** (Linux VA-API) - Alternative fallback
4. **CPU** - Final fallback, still performant

### GPU Scaling Feature
When CUDA hardware acceleration works, the system also tests if **GPU-based video scaling** is available:

**GPU Scaling Enabled** (Driver 550.x):
- Frames stay in GPU memory for scaling
- Uses `scale_cuda` filter (much faster than CPU scaling)
- Full pipeline: `decode (GPU) → scale (GPU) → download to CPU`
- Logs: `✓ GPU scaling (scale_cuda) available - will use for frame extraction`

**GPU Scaling Disabled** (Driver 572.16+ or incompatible):
- Frames transferred to CPU for scaling
- Uses standard `scale` filter (still fast)
- Logs: `ℹ️  GPU scaling unavailable - using CPU scaling (still fast)`

## Driver Version Compatibility

### ✅ Recommended: NVIDIA Driver 550.x Series (e.g., 550.127.05)

**Status**: Full CUDA hardware acceleration support

**Performance**:
- Video decoding: GPU-accelerated via CUDA
- Video scaling: GPU-accelerated via scale_cuda filter
- Image matching: GPU-accelerated via PyTorch CUDA
- Expected speedup: 5-10x for video decoding, 2-3x for GPU scaling, 2-8x for image matching

**Configuration**:
- Base image: `nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04`
- Libraries: `libnvidia-decode-530`, `libnvidia-encode-530`
- FFmpeg: Ubuntu package (4.4.2) with `-hwaccel cuda`

**Why it works**:
- Driver 550.x is well-tested with CUDA 11.8
- Stable production driver with extensive FFmpeg testing
- Library versions (530/560 series) are compatible

### ⚠️ Limited Support: NVIDIA Driver 572.16+ Series

**Status**: CUDA detection works but GPU not fully utilized

**Behavior**:
- FFmpeg accepts `-hwaccel cuda` but falls back to CPU decoding
- Image matching still GPU-accelerated via PyTorch
- No errors, but reduced video decoding performance

**Why limited**:
- Driver 572.16 introduced breaking changes to CUVID API
- Library mismatch: installed 530/560 series libs, driver is 572
- Codec-specific decoders (`h264_cuvid`) fail with `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE`

**Workaround**:
- System automatically falls back to QSV or CPU for video decoding
- Image matching remains GPU-accelerated
- Overall performance still acceptable

## What Doesn't Work (Any Driver Version)

### ❌ Codec-Specific CUVID Decoders
```bash
# These fail with CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE on driver 572.16+
-c:v h264_cuvid
-c:v hevc_cuvid
-c:v vp9_cuvid
```

**Reason**: Direct CUVID decoder usage triggers GPU device initialization issues

**Solution**: Use generic `-hwaccel cuda` instead, let FFmpeg choose decoder

### ❌ GPU Memory Output Format
```bash
# This fails on driver 572.16+
-hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda
```

**Reason**: Keeping frames in GPU memory requires additional device initialization that fails

**Solution**: Omit `-hwaccel_output_format`, let frames transfer to CPU memory

### ❌ GPU-Based Scaling
```bash
# This requires GPU memory output, which doesn't work
-vf scale_cuda=-1:480
```

**Reason**: Depends on `-hwaccel_output_format cuda`

**Solution**: Use CPU-based scaling `-vf scale=-1:480` (still fast)

## Testing Your System

### Check Driver Version
```bash
docker compose exec tv-identifier nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv,noheader
```

### Check Hardware Acceleration Detection
```bash
docker compose logs tv-identifier | grep "Hardware acceleration detected"
```

Expected output for driver 550.x:
```
✓ NVIDIA CUDA hardware acceleration detected (driver 550.127.05)
  Using GPU-accelerated video decoding
```

Expected output for driver 572.16+:
```
ℹ️  NVIDIA GPU detected (driver 572.16) but CUDA hwaccel failed
   This is expected with driver 572.16+ - trying fallback methods
✓ Hardware acceleration detected: QSV
```

### Monitor GPU Usage During Extraction
```bash
# In container
nvidia-smi dmon -s u
```

**Driver 550.x**: Should show 20-50% GPU utilization during video processing
**Driver 572.16+**: Shows 0-2% GPU utilization (CPU decoding), but 60-90% during image matching

## Deployment Recommendations

### For Production (Driver 550.127.05)
- ✅ Use current configuration as-is
- ✅ Full GPU acceleration for both video and image processing
- ✅ Optimal performance

### For Development/Testing (Driver 572.16+)
- ✅ Current configuration works without errors
- ℹ️ Video decoding uses QSV or CPU (still fast)
- ✅ Image matching uses GPU (full acceleration)
- ℹ️ Slightly slower than optimal, but functional

### To Maximize Performance on Driver 572.16+
**Option 1**: Downgrade to driver 550.x series (recommended)
```bash
# On host
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-550
```

**Option 2**: Use FFmpeg with newer CUDA support
- Build custom FFmpeg with CUDA 12.x support
- Requires significant Dockerfile changes
- Not tested

**Option 3**: Accept CPU video decoding
- No changes needed
- Adequate performance for most use cases
- GPU still used for image matching (primary bottleneck)

## Current System Status

**Test Environment** (Driver 572.16):
- Video decoding: QSV (Intel hardware) or CPU
- Image matching: GPU (PyTorch CUDA)
- Status: ✅ Working, adequate performance

**Production Target** (Driver 550.127.05):
- Video decoding: GPU (CUDA)
- Image matching: GPU (PyTorch CUDA)
- Status: ✅ Expected to work optimally

## Technical Details

### Why Driver 550.x Works Better

1. **API Stability**: CUDA 11.8 was designed and tested with driver 520-550 series
2. **Library Compatibility**: `libnvidia-decode-530` matches driver 550 better than 572
3. **CUVID Stability**: CUVID API is stable in this driver range
4. **FFmpeg Testing**: Ubuntu FFmpeg 4.4.2 was validated against these drivers

### Why Driver 572.16 Has Issues

1. **Breaking Changes**: NVIDIA updated CUVID API in 572.x series
2. **Library Mismatch**: Container has 530/560 libs, host has 572 driver
3. **Initialization Changes**: GPU device initialization sequence changed
4. **Compatibility Gap**: FFmpeg 4.4.2 predates driver 572 by ~2 years

### Adaptive Detection Logic

The application uses this detection sequence:

```python
1. Check for NVIDIA GPU and driver version
2. Test: ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -f lavfi -i testsrc -f null -
3. If successful → Use CUDA
4. If failed → Test QSV, VAAPI, etc.
5. If all failed → Use CPU
```

This ensures:
- Optimal performance on supported drivers
- Graceful degradation on newer drivers
- No errors, always functional
- Automatic adaptation to system capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### "CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE: invalid device ordinal"
**Cause**: Using codec-specific CUVID decoders or `-hwaccel_output_format cuda` on incompatible driver
**Solution**: Let the application auto-detect; it will fall back automatically

### "No hardware acceleration detected"
**Cause**: GPU not passed to container or driver issues
**Check**:
```bash
docker compose exec tv-identifier nvidia-smi
```
**Solution**: Verify docker-compose.yml has proper GPU configuration

### Low GPU utilization during video extraction
**Expected on**: Driver 572.16+ (uses CPU/QSV instead)
**Expected on**: Driver 550.x should show 20-50% GPU usage
**Check**: Image matching should still use GPU heavily (60-90%)
